### Technologies
1. Node.js
2. TypeScript
3. MongoDB with MongoDB native driver (mongodb package on NPM)
4. InversifyJS as an IoC container
5. Express (via Inversify Express Utils) as an API framework

## Getting Started
To run the project, make sure you have these dependencies installed on your system

1. Node.js v8 or later
2. Typescript with `tsc` command
3. Nodemon
4. ts-node
5. MongoDB

You also need to setup and initialise MongoDB database. Then, copy the `.env_example` file into `.env` file by firing the command

cp .env_template .env
````

Do adjust the DB_NAME and MONGODB_URI to match your configuration then run

````bash
yarn dev
````
